# State Decoded Assets

## Favicons, Apple Touch Icons

Each of these icons should somehow correlate to the political entity that is the subject of the website. With Virginia, we used the seal icon that was created for the site. The larger touch icons have bitmapped `0`s and `1`s fading across, representing digital bits being “decoded,” as it were. Feel free to edit the images to suit your needs. We recommend running any images through [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) to squeeze out excess file size.
