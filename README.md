# State Decoded Assets

Assets used in the creation of [The State Decoded](/statedecoded/statedecoded/) that are liable to be useful to others in their own development of or implementation of the software.

## Favicons, Apple Touch Icons

Each of these icons should somehow correlate to the political entity that is the subject of the website. With Virginia, we used the seal icon that was created for the site. The larger touch icons have bitmapped `0`s and `1`s fading across, representing digital bits being “decoded,” as it were. Feel free to edit the images to suit your needs. We recommend running any images through [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) to squeeze out excess file size.
